# Log-33
Our entry to the Python Discord code jam is the brain twisting, head scratching, hopefully somewhat interesting puzzle 
game that is log-3


If you've ever had the urge to puzzle over what language Dracula programs in. Or what operating system a cyclops might 
use,  then this is the game for you.
## The game 
![Example screen](https://github.com/CharlieADavies/game-jam-2020/blob/dev/the-comet-that-shook-the-py/screenshot_1.PNG)

The aim of the game is to full the octothrope whilst following the rules. 

There are three rows with three categories:
* The first row is full of **monsters**
* The second row is their favourite **programming languages**
* The third row is their **operating system**

When you've figured out the clues, you can submit the game - if you got it right, you can try again - and try to do it faster
