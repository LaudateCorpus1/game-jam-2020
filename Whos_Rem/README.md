### 3 Strings!
Welcome to 3 strings, the game made by Whos_Rem (ChillFish8 (CF8), and JamieSaunders03)

## Dependancies
- YOU MUST HAVE VLC MEDIA INSTALLED PRIOR TO THIS!
- Arcade
- python-vlc
- PyAudioGUI

## VLC Install not working - FIX!:
Should python-vlc not find the VLC dll follow these steps:
- Go to your VLC folder (Sometimes under VideoLan)
- Copy the path e.g `C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC`
- Do `set PATH=<The path your just copied>;%PATH%` in your cmd (or venv cmd depending on if in use)
- Re run the program via CMD

## Credit where credit is due:
Thank you to the song creators who let us use their music in this!
