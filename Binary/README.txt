Genre: Maybe platformer or puzzle?

Theme: RGB -> Different section of the level will be shown depending on what color is equipped.

Mechanics: Colors can be switched in real time, revealing new sections and making others disappear.
	   Level design must be centered around this.
           
           Puzzle game. No enemies. Platformer. I'll try my best.
