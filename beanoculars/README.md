> Insane Irradiated Insects, made by sachapomme (Sacha#8175)

## About
This game was made for the Python Discord's Game Jam 2020. The theme was "Three of a kind" and the participants had 10 days to do the best game possible, using the arcade library. I was alone in my team.

## Concept
The idea was to make a tower defense game, where you only have three towers that you have to replace during the rounds to defeat the three types of mutant bugs that want to destroy the city, coming from the three paths available. You play as a helicopter which must grab your towers and put them near their favorite type of insect to destroy, optimizing your travels and the use of your turrets. The first 50 waves of enemies are pre-made, and after that point, they are generated with by a function, being harder and harder.

## Setup
1. Download this repository.
2. Make sure you have the latest versions of pip, wheel and setuptools.
3. Create a virtual environnement and install pipenv: `pip install pipenv`
4. Install the dependencies: `pipenv install`
5. Run the game: `pipenv run start`

## Notes
It's my first time using pipenv and github, I really hope that this works, otherwise I'd be thankful if you messaged me on discord: Sacha#8175.
I am not a native english speaker so if there's some mistake of language, please let me know on discord.
Pro tip: clicking far from the helicopter makes it move faster.

## Licenses
I made all the images for the game myself and the code is using the Arcade library by Paul Vincent Craven, which license is found in the `submission` folder.
