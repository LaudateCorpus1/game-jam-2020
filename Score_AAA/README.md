# 3 Keys on the Run

## Presentation
3 Keys on the Run is a game realised with arcade python in the context of [pydis game jam 2020](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/events/game-jam-2020/).
The theme was '3 of a kind'

You only need 3 keys to play this game, Q, W and E ( A, Z and E for french keyboards).
The goal of the game is to hit the correct key, when the circle is in the valid grey zone.

*Depending on where you hit, you can get "Ok", "Super" and "PERFECT"*

Chaining corrects inputs raise your combo meter, the higher the combo meter is, the more point you gain for each input!
Be wary, missing a circle, or having false input reset your combo to 0 and you lose a life orb. You start with 5 lives and
once they reach 0, it's GAME OVER. There is 3 levels of difficulty, triggered when you reach a certain score, making the
circle faster.

If you have a GAME OVER, you are directed toward the High Score screen. If you are among the best, 
you have the opportunity to enter 3 letters to commemorate your achievment. Try to be **#1**!

for the last panel I just wanted a space effect, and seen one similar in Neptunia Shooter.
For the letters in the various "ok", "miss", "super", they were redrawn based on a Super Mario Bross 3 font image i
