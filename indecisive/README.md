This Game Jam have the theme `Three of a kind` with the addition requirements of:
 - Your project must use the Python Arcade Library. 
 It is not permitted to work around this by, e.g., using the Python Arcade Libary as a wrapper for another framework.
 - The majority of your project must be written in Python.
 - Your project must be feasible to run and simple to set up on a desktop computer.
 - You are allowed to use existing assets, like images and sound effects, as long as the licenses of those assets permit it. 
 Typically, this means that the assets are licensed under an OSI-approved or Creative Commons license, or is in the public domain.
 - All projects should start from scratch and all code must be written within the time constrictions of the jam.
