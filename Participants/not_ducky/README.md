# not ducky

## running the game

run `pipenv install` and `pipenv run game`.

## notes

code quality is super-duper messy, as i didn't have that much time to work on it and make sure it was perfect. (for example, the repeating draw_text statements -- didn't seem to work when i made a wrapper around it that passed in stuff like the font).

should also have standardized or changed way of passing in variables: quit messy, and some things shouldn't be essential while screen_number is essential.
