# The story of З, Ȝ, and Ʒ

This is the story of three planets: Ze, Yogh, and Ezh.

Each are made of one of the three elements of alchemy, and one of the three classes of combatant.

Each wishes to be the strongest, to destroy all others.

And they each could do it.

Ze could destroy Ezh.

Yogh could destroy Ze.

Ezh could destroy Yogh.

And yet if one is destroyed, the three alchemic elements would be incomplete, and we would not be able to fabricate the third periodic element: Lithium.

Lithium is a valuable material, and each planet knows it.

Each planet is working to detect how far the nearest source is.

But they cannot find it. For they cannot work together.

Over time, ages to them but only seconds to you, they will determine how far each source is.

You can use all three. You can triangulate the location.

You can bring this lithium home if you wish, but if the planets thrive, they will guide you towards more.

They, too, need lithium to survive. How much you reserve for home and how much you use on them is up to you.

You must balance three tasks: Collect lithium, heal wounded planets, and abscond when all is lost.

Do not wait too long to abscond, for you will need all three planets alive to escape.

# How to start
`pipenv install`

`pipenv run start`

# How to play
Each planet will give off a circle indicating the distance from the planet to a source of lithium.

Using all three planets, figure out where the lithium is and click on it! You will get a certain amount of lithium depending on the health of the planets.

Over time, the three planets will fight and get hurt. A damaged planet is much smaller than the others.

When you have at least one unit of lithium, you can click on a planet to heal it.

The more damaged a planet is, the weaker its triangulation signal is.

Your goal is to abscond with as much lithium as you can.

When you feel that it is time, hit the "Abscond" button.

If even one planet is destroyed, you can never go home.
