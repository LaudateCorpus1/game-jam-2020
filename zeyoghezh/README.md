The goal is to use all 3 planets to alchemize lithium.

With lithium, we can strengthen planets in danger of being destroyed.

Using all 3 planets, we can triangulate far sources of lithium.

When two planets get close, they will start fighting. The winner would be determined by the planets' strengths and the advantages to each planet. When a planet is damaged, its strength goes down.

The player will have to be making sure to keep the planets healthy while also trying to figure out where the lithium is located. It should keep the player interested, for risk of failing a task.

Inputs by the player:
* Choose to strengthen one of the planets
* Use the results of the planets' triangulation to answer some question about where the lithium is
  * Maybe the planets occasionally give off circles around them, and you have to click where the triangulated location is
