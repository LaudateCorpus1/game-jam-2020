Test attack sounds
Add combat effects (not just lines)
Improve aesthetic

Could the damage lines be cones, big on source and point on target? (Won't matter if George finishes)
Make game over screen look better; maybe just put a background behind the text? Same with lithium count text.

Auto fade out and restart at game over

Maybe during the tutorial the abscond button is locked, so you have to AT LEAST finish the tutorial, and then you decide whether to continue or abscond?

Make sure music repeats.

Have the attack line be the min of the previous logic and the size of the planet (so a strong attack will make the planet look like the base of a cone when we add the thing about making it a cone)
