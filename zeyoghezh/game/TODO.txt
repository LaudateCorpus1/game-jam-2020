Test attack sounds
Add combat effects (not just lines)
Improve aesthetic

Could the damage lines be cones, big on source and point on target? (Won't matter if George finishes)
Make game over screen look better; maybe just put a background behind the text? Same with lithium count text.

Make an intro video explaining how it works

Auto fade out and restart at game over

Show words at the top as a tutorial at the beginning. Have the steps be to collect lithium and heal a planet. Until the steps are over, time goes 1/3 speed or whatever. Or maybe just have the only step be to collect lithium, then full speed, but the tutorial continues (click a planet to heal it). Once you've healed a planet, the story starts playing in the tutorial text screen, while you play the game. Maybe during the tutorial the abscond button is locked, so you have to AT LEAST finish the tutorial, and then you decide whether to continue or abscond?

Have the game over screen also show on the tutorial screen, have it start with "All is lost;" or "You've escaped" or whatever

Make sure music repeats.

Have the attack line be the min of the previous logic and the size of the planet (so a strong attack will make the planet look like the base of a cone when we add the thing about making it a cone)

"Click on the intersection of all three projected circles."
"Do it again." (Until player has at least 1 unit of lithium)
"Click on a planet to strengthen it."
Then go through the readme's story

Make triangulation circles happen more frequently during tutorial

Maybe when the banner text changes it has a random y coordinate?
