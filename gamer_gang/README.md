k judges  
this only works if your current working directory is my team repo  
###running directions
so your file path has to be like C:/Users/stuff/game-jam-2020 for this game to work  
so yea you're gonna have to run: "python gamer_gang/triple_blocks.py"  
there might be some other ones but idk  
maybe requirements.txt too but idk  
###game mechanics
up, left, right OR WAD to move  
1, 2, 3 to control the green, red, and purple squares (or cubes whatever you wanna call 'em)  
down or S to split the stack that you're currently in  
get on top of another cube to join with them  
collect starts to increase your score  
you have to get all three squares/cubes to the exit door (a black box) at the end of the level to complete it
