## About

This repository is Triple Dungeon's submittion for [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com/)'s [Game Jam 2020](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/events/game-jam-2020/). 

This game is far from complete. We ran into some serious lag issues half way though the project, but all agreed that it was a good experience.

## Install
This game can be installed with `pipenv sync`

## Instructions
Use WASD to move and the mouse to aim and fire.
Use left shift to cycle through different monster combinations and try to shoot the monsters in that order.
