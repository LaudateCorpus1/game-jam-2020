## About

This repository is Triple Dungeon's submittion for [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com/)'s [Game Jam 2020](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/events/game-jam-2020/). 

This game is far from complete. We ran into some serious lag issues half way though the project, but all agreed that it was a good experience.

## Setup
This game can be setup and run with:
`pipenv sync`
`pipenv shell`
`python main.py`

## Instructions
Use WASD to move and the mouse to aim and fire.
Use left shift to cycle through different monster combinations and try to shoot the monsters in that order to recieve a speed boost. Once all the monsters are gone you will move onto another level.
